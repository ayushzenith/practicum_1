    "The `ipynb` format stores outputs from the last time you ran the notebook.  (When you open a notebook it has the figures and outputs of the last time you ran it too).  To ensure that your submitted `ipynb` file represents your latest code, make sure to give a fresh run `Kernel > Restart & Run All` just before uploading the `ipynb` file to Canvas.\n",

Pop into office hours or DM us in MS Teams if you have a specific question about your work or if you would like another pair of eyes or talk through your code.\n",

For more information, read the following article [How to Write Beautiful Python Code With PEP 8](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/) or ask your TA's for tips.\n",
